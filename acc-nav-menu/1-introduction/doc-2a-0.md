## Introduction

The ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) maintains that navigation menus should be built using the Disclosure (Show/Hide) pattern, and warns against using the Menu | Menubar pattern for such purposes. In this article, we will examine the APG Example Disclosure Navigation Menu and the associated Disclosure design pattern to see how these can be utilized as the basis for creating robust and arbitrarily complex navigation menus. We will also take a closer look at why you should not base navigation menus on the APG Menu | Menubar design pattern.

This article will take you, step-by-step, through the Example Disclosure Navigation Menu and try to fill in gaps where it may not be obvious why certain choices were made. The main objective of this article is to clarify the why, what, and how of building accessible navigation menus using the APG Disclosure pattern, and to go a few steps beyond the basic implementation that the APG Example Disclosure Navigation Menu provides.

It will also delve into the confusing mixture of advice on how navigation menus should behave, much of which is implicit by nature of the design patterns that are in common usage. Most importantly, this article will argue that the most accessible design pattern on which to base navigation menus is the Disclosure pattern and the Example Disclosure Navigation Menu, both of which are described in detail in the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide.

By utilizing accessible design patterns in building navigation menus, the larger goal of ‘achieving parity’ among the user experiences of different types of users can be reached, regardless of the physical means of interaction being employed.
