## Introduction

This article will delve into the confusing mixture of advice on how navigation menus should behave, much of which is implicit by nature of the design patterns that are in common usage. Furthermore, this article will argue that the most accessible design pattern on which to base navigation menus is the Disclosure pattern and the Example Disclosure Navigation Menu, both of which are described in detail in the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide.

There are many different design patterns currently being used for navigation menus. Many of these include the ‘open submenu on hover’ behavior, which, this article contends, leads to a less than optimal user experience for keyboard-only users.

So how should we determine the user experience best practices for building accessible navigation menus? This article will examine the user experiences of different types of users and argue that accessibility is optimized only when our goal is ‘achieving equity’ with respect to those user experiences.

Unfortunately, the best resource for understanding accessible design patterns for navigation menus, the ARIA APG, is itself somewhat confusing. If you know what to look for and what to ignore, you will be okay, and this article will hopefully clarify that.
