## Getting Started

One of the main goals of this article, as we get further into the technical aspects and details of building navigation menus, is to take a closer look at the APG Example Disclosure Navigation Menu, which is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and highlight the accessibility features that are implemented within each of these technology areas.

Before we get to that point, however, there are a number of related questions and themes that we need to touch upon and provide answers for:

1. What design patterns and their associated behaviors are currently being used in implementing navigation menus?

2. Why is there so much confusion in trying to use the APG to figure out what design patterns should be used for navigation menus?

3. What is the history of menu design patterns and does this explain why some of this confusion exists?
