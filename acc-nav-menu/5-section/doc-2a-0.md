## 4. APG Disclosure Navigation Menu

For website navigation menus, the disclosure navigation menu pattern provides what keyboard-only users expect: Tabbing through menu lists and pressing Enter or Spacebar to activate a menu item (i.e., either a menu button that expands or collapses a submenu, or a menu item link that takes you to another page).

The key concepts for this pattern are ‘toggling’ and 'tabbing': menu buttons toggle the visibility of their submenus, and the primary keyboard interaction for the traversal of menus and submenus is tabbing.
