## User Experience

One of the foundational principles of web accessibility from a user experience perspective is the desire to make the efficiency of accessing information as similar as possible for users of different abilities. It should not be far more difficult and time-consuming for a keyboard-only user to interact with a navigation menu than it is for someone using a mouse or trackpad, or other pointing device.

To emphasize this principle, which we will refer to as “achieving parity”, we will delve into some of the accessibility implications that arise from trying to incorporate features such as “expand on hover” that are seen in many navigation menus in the wild. After analyzing some of these implications, it should become clear that “expand on hover” is a feature best omitted from our designs.
