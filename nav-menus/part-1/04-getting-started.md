## Getting Started

To begin with, we will look at the APG Disclosure Navigation Menu example, which is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to call out the accessibility features included within each of these areas.

### Terminology

This article will use the following terms in order to discuss navigation menus:

* Navigation Menu: a hierarchical collection of menu items. On desktop page formats, the top-level menu is typically always visible, and may be organized as a horizontal menu bar (series of menu buttons).

* Menu Item: an interactive element in a navigation menu with a label that describes the element. The menu item may exhibit only one of two possible behaviors. Either it acts as a link to another web page, or as a menu button that opens an initially hidden submenu containing additional menu items.

* Submenu:  a group of menu items that can be shown or hidden by activating a menu button. These are sometimes referred to as dropdown or fly-out menus.

* Menu Button: a menu item that controls the visibility of a submenu. Often menu buttons are distinguished from menu items that are links by including an arrow or chevron icon indicating that it controls the visibility of additional menu items in a submenu.

### Navigation Menu Structure

The example Disclosure Navigation Menu provided by the APG has a very simple structure, which makes it easier to understand and discuss. It comprises a set of disclosure buttons (menu buttons) arranged horizontally, where each button controls a submenu that is a simple flat list of links.
