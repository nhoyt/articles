## Introduction

The ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) maintains that navigation menus should be built using the Disclosure (Show/Hide) pattern, and warns against using the Menu | Menubar pattern for such purposes. In this article, we will examine the APG Disclosure design pattern and the Example Disclosure Navigation Menu to see how these can be utilized as the basis for creating robust and arbitrarily complex navigation menus. We will also take a closer look at why you should not base navigation menus on the APG Menu | Menubar design pattern.

This article will take you, step-by-step, through the Example Disclosure Navigation Menu and try to fill in gaps where it may not be obvious why certain choices were made. The main objective of this article is to clarify the what, why, and how of building accessible navigation menus using the APG Disclosure pattern, and to go a few steps beyond the basic implementation that the APG Example Disclosure Navigation Menu provides.

### Intended Audience

This article is intended for web developers and designers who are accessibility-minded. It assumes that you have experience in at least one of the following two areas:

1. Web development — building accessible websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
1. Web design/user experience — ensuring that the user experience is optimized for all users, regardless of ability.
