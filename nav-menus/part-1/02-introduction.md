## Introduction

The ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) specifies that website navigation menus should utilize the Disclosure pattern, and recommends against using the Menu | Menubar pattern for navigation menus. In this article, we will examine the APG Disclosure design pattern and Disclosure Navigation Menu example to see how these can be utilized as the basis for creating robust and arbitrarily complex navigation menus. We will also take a closer look at why you should not base navigation menus on the APG Menu | Menubar design pattern.

This article will take you, step-by-step, through the APG Disclosure Navigation Menu example and try to fill in gaps where it may not be obvious why certain choices were made. The main objective of this article is to clarify the what, how and why of building accessible navigation menus using the APG Disclosure pattern, and to go a few steps beyond the basic implementation that the APG Disclosure Navigation Menu example provides.
