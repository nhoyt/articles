## Conclusions

We have examined in detail the user experience of keyboard-only users when interacting with navigation menus, and compared their experience with that of pointing device and touchscreen users. We have also learned how to assess whether the keyboard interaction model is coherent and complete. It is left up to you to judge whether or not these experiences and modalities are relatively similar, or at least as closely related as possible.

Regarding the technical implementation details of building accessible navigation menus, this article has shown how to build on a relatively simple standards-based foundation of HTML markup in order to add the behaviors that our interaction models call for.

Finally, by delving into the JavaScript code of the nav-menu-example on GitHub, some of the less obvious software development requirements for creating real-world navigation menus with nested submenus are unearthed and for these, possible solutions are proposed.
